# Recent Fixes Summary - Latest Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the most recent fixes and improvements made to the Enough Image Editor based on user feedback and bug reports.

## üîß Major Fixes Implemented

### 1. Text Editor Modal Deactivation Fix
**Problem**: Users had to press Delete key to close text editor modal instead of clicking the X button.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `renderTextEditorModal()` to call `deactivateAllTextBoxes()` when X is clicked
- Now behaves intuitively - X button properly closes the modal
- Maintains personality: "Make Your Words Shine" title preserved

**Files Modified**: `ui/UI.cpp` (line 958)

### 2. Selection Tool Behavior Fix
**Problem**: Selection tool was moving and shrinking objects on every click, causing frustration.

**Solution**:
- **FIXED**: Commented out problematic right-click handling that caused unwanted scaling
- **Regular left click**: Only selection (no transform operations)
- **Shift + Left click**: Scale/transform mode only
- Removed the automatic shrinking behavior that occurred on every click
- Transform operations now only happen when shift is explicitly held

**Files Modified**: `tools/ToolManager.cpp` (lines 1053-1075)

### 3. Filter Stacking Crash Prevention
**Problem**: Applying blur then grayscale (or vice versa) caused segmentation faults.

**Solution**:
- **HACK**: Implemented genius buffer image system - create hidden buffer, apply filter, then replace!
- Added `m_filterBuffer` to safely handle filter operations
- Enhanced filter tracking with `FilterType` enum  
- **FIXED**: Now you can stack blur + grayscale without crashes - buffer prevents segfaults
- Maintained personality comments: "WARNING: Using blur then grayscale can cause segfaults" and "(Enough is cute)"

**Files Modified**: 
- `canvas/Canvas.hpp` (lines 126-135)
- `canvas/Canvas.cpp` (lines 918-1200)

### 4. ImGui Shutdown Assertion Fix
**Problem**: Application crashed on exit with assertion failure in ImGui renderer backend.

**Solution**:
- Added proper initialization checks in `UI::cleanup()`
- Only calls shutdown functions if properly initialized
- Prevents double-shutdown scenarios

**Files Modified**: `ui/UI.cpp` (lines 145-150)

### 5. Improved Undo System Fix
**Problem**: Ctrl+Z was "nuking everything" instead of undoing recent changes properly.

**Solution**:
- **FIXED**: Undo now maintains proper history stack (up to 50 operations)
- Added `limitHistorySize()` to prevent memory bloat
- Each filter operation now saves undo state before applying
- **HACK**: History limit prevents memory issues - 50 seems reasonable
- Granular undo instead of all-or-nothing approach

**Files Modified**: 
- `editor/Editor.hpp` (lines 35-72)
- `editor/Editor.cpp` (lines 85-195)
- `canvas/Canvas.cpp` (filter functions)

## üÜï New Features Added

### 1. Flood Selection Tool
**Inspired by**: Flood fill algorithm (directly stated in comments)

**Features**:
- **Magic wand selection**: Click to select similar colored areas
- **Tolerance control**: Adjustable color similarity (0-100)
- **Delete functionality**: Press Delete key to remove selected pixels
- **Visual feedback**: Blue overlay shows selection in real-time
- **Undo support**: Saves state before destructive operations

**Implementation**:
- Tool index: 8 (FloodSel button)
- Stack-based algorithm for memory efficiency
- Proper boundary checking prevents crashes
- Layer-aware selection system
- Undo support for destructive operations

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/Tool.hpp` (lines 249-272)
- `tools/ToolManager.cpp` (lines 1177-1425)
- `ui/UI.cpp` (tool panel and properties)

### 2. Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts
**Added**:
- **Delete**: Delete flood-selected pixels (make transparent)
- **Ctrl+D**: Deselect all selections
- **Escape**: Cancel current tool operation (existing)

**Files Modified**: `tools/ToolManager.cpp` (lines 76-83)

## üé® UI Layout Improvements

### 1. Reorganized Panel Layout
**Changes**:
- **Layers panel**: Moved down by 50% total (now at 50% of screen height)
- **Tool properties**: Moved to bottom with scrolling capability
- **Colors panel**: Given more space (15% of screen height)
- **Proper scrolling**: Tool properties now scroll if content exceeds view
- **Fixed overlap**: Layers panel no longer covers colors panel

**Rationale**: 
- Tool properties should stay accessible at bottom
- Colors need more space for better UX
- Layers moved down further to prevent covering colors
- User feedback addressed: "move layers down by another 30%"

**Files Modified**: `ui/UI.cpp` (lines 165-198)

### 2. Tool Panel Reordering
**New Order**:
1. Pencil
2. Eraser  
3. Line
4. Rectangle
5. Circle
6. Triangle
7. Fill
8. **Select** (moved up)
9. **FloodSel** (new)
10. **Text** (moved down)
11. **Gradient** (moved down)
12. Healing

**Files Modified**: 
- `tools/ToolManager.cpp` (init function)
- `ui/UI.cpp` (tool panel buttons)
