# Refactoring Report: From Procedural to OOP

## Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring process undertaken to transform the Enough Image Editor from a procedural approach to an object-oriented design. The refactoring maintained all existing functionality while improving code organization, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Key Changes

### 1. Class Structure Implementation

- **Singleton Classes**: Created singleton patterns for core components:
  - `Canvas`: Manages the drawing surface and layers
  - `Editor`: Handles undo/redo and selection operations
  - `ToolManager`: Manages tool selection and properties
  - `UI`: Manages the user interface

- **Class Hierarchy**: Implemented proper inheritance hierarchies:
  - Base `Tool` class with derived tool implementations
  - `Layer` class for encapsulating layer properties
  - `HistoryState` class for undo/redo operations

### 2. Memory Management Improvements

- **RAII Principles**: Implemented proper resource acquisition and release
  - Resources acquired in constructors
  - Resources released in destructors
  - Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`) for ownership semantics

- **Move Semantics**: Added move constructors and move assignment operators for efficient resource transfer

### 3. Code Organization

- **Header Files**: Clean, well-organized header files with proper access specifiers
  - Public interface methods clearly defined
  - Private implementation details hidden

- **Implementation Files**: Clear separation of functionality
  - Each class implementation in its own file(s)
  - Logical grouping of related functions

- **Unified Header**: Created `Paint.hpp` for easy inclusion of all components

### 4. Design Pattern Implementation

- **Singleton Pattern**: For global access to core components
- **Strategy Pattern**: For interchangeable tool implementations
- **Command Pattern**: For undo/redo operations
- **Observer Pattern**: For UI updates and event handling

## File Structure Changes

### Before Refactoring

```
Paint/
├── canvas.cpp/.hpp         # Canvas and layer functions
├── tools.cpp/.hpp          # Drawing tools and input handling
├── editor.cpp/.hpp         # Edit operations and history
├── ui.cpp/.hpp             # User interface implementation
└── main.cpp                # Main application entry point
```

### After Refactoring

```
Paint/
├── Canvas.hpp/cpp          # Canvas singleton class
├── Canvas2.cpp             # Additional Canvas implementations
├── Layer.hpp/cpp           # Layer class for encapsulation
├── Tool.hpp                # Tool class hierarchy
├── ToolManager.cpp         # Tool implementations
├── Editor.hpp/cpp          # Edit operations and history
├── UI.hpp/cpp              # User interface implementation
├── Paint.hpp               # Unified header for all components
└── main.cpp                # Updated main application entry point
```

## Refactoring Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Circular Dependencies

**Challenge**: Classes like `Tool` and `Canvas` needed to reference each other.

**Solution**: Used forward declarations and careful header organization to break circular dependencies.

### 2. Global State Management

**Challenge**: The original code relied heavily on global variables.

**Solution**: Implemented the Singleton pattern for core components, providing global access without actual global variables.

### 3. Resource Management

**Challenge**: Original code had potential memory leaks with SDL resources.

**Solution**: Implemented proper RAII with constructors/destructors to ensure resources are properly managed.

### 4. Tool Polymorphism

**Challenge**: Different drawing tools needed different behaviors but with a common interface.

**Solution**: Created a base `Tool` class with virtual methods, allowing polymorphic behavior through derived classes.

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. Improved Maintainability

- **Encapsulated State**: Class properties are now properly encapsulated
- **Focused Responsibilities**: Each class has a single responsibility
- **Reduced Complexity**: Methods are shorter and more focused

### 2. Enhanced Extensibility

- **Easier to Add Features**: New tools can be added by deriving from the `Tool` class
- **Modular Design**: Components can be modified independently
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces between components

### 3. Better Code Organization

- **Logical Grouping**: Related functionality grouped in classes
- **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies between components are explicit
- **Improved Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully transformed the Enough Image Editor from a procedural design to an object-oriented architecture. The new code maintains all the original functionality while significantly improving organization, maintainability, and extensibility. The refactoring demonstrates effective use of OOP principles, design patterns, and modern C++ features.

## Recent Structural Improvements

Following the initial OOP refactoring, additional improvements were made to enhance project organization and developer experience:

### Directory Reorganization
- **Modular Structure**: Organized code into logical folders (canvas/, tools/, editor/, ui/)
- **Clean Dependencies**: Updated all include paths to use relative references
- **Build System Updates**: Modified Makefile and added CMakeLists.txt for new structure

### User Interface Enhancements
- **Responsive Panels**: UI panels now scale proportionally with window size
- **Modal Text Editor**: Replaced sidebar text editing with intuitive modal window
- **Improved Usability**: Better user experience with comprehensive text editing controls

### Development Workflow Improvements
- **Multiple Build Systems**: Added CMake as modern alternative to traditional Makefile
- **Automated Setup**: Enhanced setup.py script for dependency management
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive updates to reflect all structural changes

## Next Steps

1. **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests for the refactored classes
2. **Documentation**: Add additional documentation for public APIs
3. **Feature Expansion**: Add new tools and features using the OOP architecture
4. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize critical operations
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Validate CMake build system on Windows and macOS
