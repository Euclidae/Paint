![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be226a33-59be-428a-81b5-184679a1b9a5)


This is an enhanced paint application built with SDL2, featuring a text-based user interface (TUI), essential drawing tools, and color options. The project was inspired by Vikash Kumar's OpenGL tutorials on Udemy, and the documentation was created with assistance from DeepSeek-R1 AI assistant.
